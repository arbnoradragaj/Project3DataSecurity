# Encryption and decryption through Caesar's and Vigenere's algorithm

This is the third project created by the students of the second year of the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, as part of the exercises in the subject Data Security lectured by Ass. MÃ«rgim Hoti

# Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of an encryption/decryption application developed using Java and JavaFX. The application supports two encryption algorithms: Caesar and Vigenere. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages and files using either algorithm.
